# $\Pi$-machine

This paclet is a Wolfram Language implementation of the machine described in this [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3434290), a universal reversible state machine extended with negative and fractional types.

The machine semantically forms a compact symmetric monoidal category, which makes it a good candidate to form classical analogs of quantum computation.
